        <h1>WHAT WE DO</h1>
        <p>Improper waste management is a matter everyone around the globe is familiar with along with the consequences. 
          We as a team have decided to implement action to make the world realize the promise and the potential of the SDGs created by 
          the United Nations to protect and help the planet for a better future.And by supporting a proper waste disposal method and promoting 
          waste sorting and recycling we look forward to help the planet by covering three goals: <b>Climate action, Life below water and Life on land.</b> We also hope to 
          create a more sustainable, healthy enviornment within cities by reducing landfills,reducing burning of wastage and putting a stop to improper disposal of waste.
          The following provides a brief explanation on the negative outcomes of the failure of waste disposal methods and what we plan on doing to reduce them.

            <a name="top"><h3>Climate action</h3></a>
            <p>Every country, island and region on this planet are facing the drastic effects of climate change. 
              Greenhouse gas emission have risen by more than 50% mostly due to improper waste disposal and incineration of waste. 
              People are running out of space for landfills due to the constant increase of solid and plastic waste. </p>
             <p>By introducing an efficient and methodical garbage pickup schedule our website promotes recycling and reusing thus potentially helping to reduce landfills and reduce burning waste.
                This lends a hand in reducing carbon emission and global warming.</p>

          <div class="col">
           <h3 id="Life on land">Life on land</h3>
           
           <p>Billions of trees are chopped down every year to manufacture paper, although billions more of used recyclable paper are just being thrown out or burned. 
             The lack of recycling paper causes additional paper production which leads to increase of deforestation. Deforestation also leads to global warming since a
              higher amount of carbon is emitted to the environment due to the disruption in the carbon cycle. </p>
           <p>Our sorting guide would help people understand which materials can be recycled and help reduce the wastage 
             of recyclable materials.</p>

           <h3 id="Life below water">Life below water</h3>
          
           <p>More than 150 million tons of plastic circulates in the ocean today and the numbers are increasing. And over 8 million tons of plastic enter our ocean every year. 
             Most marine species ingest or get entangled in these human generated waste and debris and face many complications, injuries and even death. One of our priorities being recycling plastic helps in a major step to help put a stop to plastic being thrown to the ocean. 
             We hope to reduce waste items being collected or discarded into rivers or oceans by providing an efficient and reliable garbage pickup method.</p>

          <p>We can make a change! Not by words but by action. We can make the world a better place for all living
            beings. Take the first step by disposing of waste properly. Help us prove and establish the power of Reduce, reuse
            and recycle! Together we can make an imapct the world desperately needs to see.
